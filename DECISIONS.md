# ROLANPRO CRM — Decision Log

This file records durable decisions. Current activity, blockers, and next steps belong in `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

## 2026-08-24 — One cross-device source of truth

- GitHub repository `zufarataev-code/Rolan-PRO-CRM` is the shared project source.
- `main` is the only canonical code branch and the only production deployment source.
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` is the required live handoff for devices, chats, agents, and contributors.
- Chat history, agent memory, browser state, and unpushed local branches are not authoritative.
- Every task uses a short-lived branch and records its exact handoff in `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

## 2026-08-24 — One CRM data source

- PostgreSQL is the only target source of CRM business data.
- Browser/local storage may be used only as a disposable cache, never as an independent record store.
- Legacy `LegacyWorkspace.payload` data must be mapped and migrated before legacy write paths are disabled.
- Existing customer and order data must be preserved and verified during migration.

## 2026-08-24 — One operational workflow

- Canonical lifecycle: `Deal -> Consultation / Survey -> Measurement -> Proposal -> Agreement / Deposit -> Project`.
- There will be one active editor for measurement, one for proposals, and one Project record.
- Public/print proposal views are outputs from the canonical proposal record, not separate proposal engines.
- Legacy duplicates become read-only before removal.

## 2026-08-24 — Financial visibility

- Surveyors and installers must not see project totals, selling prices, costs, margins, commissions, or other financial data.
- Authorization must be enforced by server responses, not only by hiding interface elements.

## Changing a decision

Do not silently overwrite an earlier decision. Add a new dated section that names the superseded decision, explains why it changed, and links the implementing PR.
